## Joe Hannis

### Full Stack Development student. Gained a Scholarship on one of the most selective dev bootcamps in the world, after having run my own business as a professional musician for 10 years.

After 10 years working as a professional musician and tutor to clients all over the world, I found myself yearning for a new challenge in an exciting, ever evolving industry. I have always loved tech, from building gaming PCs with my brother as a kid to using Raspberrry Pi's to set up a dockerised media centre in my home. When I get onto a challenge, I struggle to put it down. 

I'm an autodictat. I taught myself to play guitar, passed grade 8 and gained a place at university. I taught myself how to navigate a commandline and use docker, and then the code that I needed to apply for the Makers scholarship. After a month of learning, I passed the technical requirements with a score of 100 percent. 10 percent of candidates are selected for the bootcamp, and a fraction of those gain a scholarshgip for free study.

I love the process of learning, and in development, the learning never stops.

Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
