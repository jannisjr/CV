Full Stack Software Engineer, scholarship gradate from Makers Academy and career changer with 10 years experience in music production, teaching and business management.

I am excited for a career in tech as I want to be continually challenged and part of an industry that is the driving force of progress in all of our lives. I am highly self motivated and I struggle to put it down a problem I haven't solved. I am passionate about learning new technologies and languages, having recently taught myself to use Docker and Github CI/CD for use in my personal projects. I love the process of learning and I get a kick out of quality, well tested code. 

I graduated from Makers bootcamp having developed skills in Node.JS, React, JavaScript and Ruby, and I haven't stopped coding every day since. I am looking for a job with opportunities for collaboration, learning and room to grow.

<h2 align="center">EDUCATION</h2>
<strong>Makers</strong> (April - August 2023)</br></br> 
During the 16 week intensive bootcamp I gained experience in Test-Driven Development with the use of:</br>
- Javascript, Node.js, React,  Jest, Cypress, Ruby, Rails, Rspec, RESTful APIs, SQL, MongoDb</br>
- Version control through Git and GitHub.</br>
- Paired programming - practised everyday, with pairs cycled to include every member of the cohort.</br> 
- I am familiar with modelling along the MVC lines, and creating applications following the principles of object-oriented programming.</br>
- I worked in three self-organising teams leaning on the agile methodology principles such as agile ceremonies and sprints.</br>
All of the work at Makers was conducted using Extreme Programming (XP) principles.</br></br>
<strong>Frontend Masters</strong>- Javascript: The Hard Parts (Aug 2023), Complete Intro to React (July 2023).</br></br>
<strong>BA(Hons) Professional Musicianship</strong> Bristol Institute of Modern Music (2010-2013)</br></br>


<h2 align="center">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
<strong>Director at Joe Hannis Guitar Ltd</strong> (June 2013-April 2023)</br>
<h5>Problem solving</h5> Adapting lessons or music to differing abilities, while ensuring results. For example, re-arranging songs into a different style and finding ways of making (often wildly different) parts fit together - ultimately, helping clients to achieve their goals.</br>
<h5>Explaining complex concepts & communication skills</h5> Like code, music is formulaic and rules based, with its own syntax. I explained these often difficult concepts to a range of students aged 6-75 (including neurodivergent and SEN) in a way that they could understand - and 100% of my students passed their music exams with merit or above.</br>
<h5>Applied creativity</h5> Creative thinking within the framework of the clientâ€™s brief. E.g. Reimagining a song so multiple stakeholders (such as artist and producer) could merge their vision of the product. This was often within tight deadlines, delivering to a budget.</br>
<h5>Interpersonal skills</h5> Managing relationships and working in teams, such as with clients or new groups of musicians, focusing on the best result for the client and ensuring coherent objectives and clear expectations.</br>
<h5>Stakeholder management</h5> Managing 50+ stakeholders (parents, clients, music agencies, studios) requiring timely updates and feedback, resulting in client loyalty and referrals.</br>
<h5>Time management</h5> Managing 43+ lessons a week, lesson planning and business administration, as well as prep work for gigs and studio sessions.</br>
