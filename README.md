10 year music teacher and musician, dedicated to a career change in software development with ever evolving challenges and continued learning. I have always loved tech, from building gaming PCs with my brother as a kid to using a Raspberry Pi to set up a Kubernetes managed media centre in my home. Technology is the driving force of progress and underpins so much of our lives, so I find the fast paced and limitlessly diverse industry fascinating. When I get into a challenge, I struggle to put it down and am highly self motivated. I am passionate about learning new technologies and languages, having recently taught myself to use Docker and Github CI/CD for use in my personal projects. I love the process of learning and I get a kick out of quality, well tested code. I graduated Makers (after receiving a scholarship) developing skills in Node.JS, React, JavaScript and Ruby, and I haven't stopped coding every day since. I am looking for a job with opportunities for collaboration and problem solving.

<h2 align="center">EDUCATION</h2>
<strong>Makers</strong> (April - August 2023)</br></br> 
During the 16 week intensive bootcamp I gained experience in Test-Driven Development with the use of:
Javascript, Node.js, React,  Jest, Cypress,, Ruby, Rails, Rspec, RESTful APIs, SQL, MongoDb.
Version control through Git and GitHub
Paired programming - practised everyday, with pairs cycled to include every member of the cohort. 
I am familiar with modelling along the MVC lines, and creating applications following the principles of object-oriented programming.
I worked in three self-organising teams leaning on the agile methodology principles such as agile ceremonies and sprints.
All of the work at Makers was conducted using Extreme Programming (XP) principles.</br></br>
<strong>Frontend Masters</strong>- Javascript: The Hard Parts (Aug 2023), Complete Intro to React (July 2023).</br></br>
<strong>BA(Hons) Professional Musicianship</strong> Bristol Institute of Modern Music (2010-2013)</br></br>


<h2 align="center">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
<strong>Director at Joe Hannis Guitar Ltd</strong> (June 2013-April 2023)</br>
<h5>Problem solving</h5> Helping clients achieve goals, working with requests and adapting to different abilities while ensuring results. I was often called to re-arrange songs into a different style/to suit a different band and would have to find ways of making often wildly different parts fit together.</br>
<h5>Explaining complex concepts</h5> Music is formulaic and rule based, with its own syntax (like code!). Being able to explain these often difficult concepts to students in a way that they can understand and apply them was key.</br>
<h5>Applied creativity</h5> Creative thinking within the framework of the clientâ€™s work or ideas. E.g. Reimagining songs to fit a client brief in a studio production environment, often under intense scrutiny and pressure.</br>
<h5>Interpersonal & communication skills</h5> Conveying complex concepts and practical applications to a range of students ages 6-75 (including neurodivergent and SEN students). Teamwork and managing relationships in high pressure environments (e.g. on stage or in a recording session).</br>
<h5>Stakeholder management</h5> Managing 50+ stakeholders (parents, adult clients, music agencies, studios) requiring timely updates and feedback.</br>
<h5>Time management</h5> Managing 43+ lessons a week, lesson planning, prep work for gigs and studio sessions and business administration.</br>


Hobbies & interests: Homebrewing, gaming & travel
