Software engineer and former business owner with experience in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, React, Ruby, Git/GitHub, JIRA, SQL and NoSQL databases, RESTful APIs, HTML, CSS and CI/CD pipelines. Proponent of agile methodologies, paired programming and TDD. With a decade of business ownership, I excel in communicating complex concepts to stakeholders, with the self motivation to learn and independently deliver. I have demonstrated my ability to learn new technologies quickly and to apply them to real-world problems, always with the user at the centre of the solution. I thrive when problem solving in challenging environments.

| [**Taplist Keg Level Manager**](https://tinyurl.com/26pfusx3)                 |Solo personal project, open-source and currently pulled over 7000 times from Docker Hub. A Docker image that utilises GitHub Actions/Workflow for CI/CD. Docker-compose uses buildx to make the image multi-architecture (currently ARM64 and AMD64 for MacOS and Linux). This React site integrates with taplist.io using API calls to track keg volume levels. The remaining keg volume is displayed on my digital taplist. A README details how an Arduino can be added to automate the process with flow sensors, with code provided.| React, JavaScript, Docker, Docker-Compose, Github Actions, HTML, CSS, Jest, Cypress, VS Code |
| [**Trail**](https://tinyurl.com/a5vmybxs)            | Greenfield React app created in a four person engineering team in two weeks. Integrates API calls to AI services to generate audio tours. We used TDD, paired programming and agile principles. ([Link to my presentation on the app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mSIrJ8QDvIhS6k-yOBnWxjJ6bwq7LsCW/view?usp=drive_link)) | React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jest, Cypress, VS Code, Git, Vite, Trello Board, Agile Ceremonies (standups and retros)  |
| [**Beer Recipe Builder**](https://tinyurl.com/bdhkd47e)                | Typescript project to generate brewing recipes using generative AI. Selectors narrow down a beer choice, and then a recipe and instructions are returned along with an AI generated image of the final product. | React, TypeScript, Tailwind, OpenAI API, Vite, Git, VS Code |
