Software engineer and bootcamp graduate with experience in React, Vue, Next JS, JavaScript, Node.js, Git/GitHub, SQL databases, RESTful APIs, HTML, and CSS. Proponent of agile methodologies, paired programming, TDD, version control and CI/CD pipelines. With a decade of business ownership, I excel in communicating complex concepts to stakeholders, with the self motivation to learn and deliver. I have demonstrated my ability to learn new technologies quickly and to apply them to real-world problems, always with the user at the centre of the solution. I love to learn, never give up on a challenge and I am eager to join a collaborative team.
