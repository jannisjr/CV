After 10 years working as a professional musician and tutor to clients all over the world, I found myself yearning for a new challenge in an exciting, ever evolving industry. I have always loved tech, from building gaming PCs with my brother as a kid to using Raspberrry Pi's to set up a dockerised media centre in my home, managed using kubernetes. When I get onto a challenge, I struggle to put it down. 

I'm an autodidact. I taught myself to play guitar, passed grade 8 and gained a place at university. I taught myself how to navigate a commandline and use docker, and then the code that I needed to apply for the Makers scholarship. After a month of learning, I passed the technical requirements with a score of 100 percent. 10 percent of candidates are selected for the bootcamp, and a fraction of those gain a scholarship for free study.

I love the process of learning, and in development, the learning never stops.

## Work Experience

Joe Hannis Guitar Ltd (June 2013 - May 2023)  
Director

- Music educator, specialising in helping GCSE and A level students prepare for studying music at degree level.
- Music production using Logic Pro X, Pro Tools.
- Live performance
- Session musician on recording sessions

## Skills

**Problem solving** - Working out a path for clients to achieve their goals, pivoting with their requests or ability, all the while ensuring results.

**Explaining complicated concepts** - Music is formulaic and rule based, with its own syntax (like code!). Being able to explain these sometimes difficult concepts to students in a way that they can not only understand but then apply to their own work was a key part of my job.

**Applied creativity** - Finding ways to be creative within the framework of a clientâ€™s work or ideas. E.g. Reworking or reimagining songs to fit a client brief in a studio production environment.

**Tech awareness** - The music industry is constantly evolving in the technology it uses, and some of these technologies come with a steep learning curve. Being able to navigate these technologies quickly, learn to use them effectively and adapt to your needs in high pressure situations is an integral part of the job.

**Interpersonal & communication skills** - Conveying complex concepts and practical applications to a range of students ages 6-75 (including neurodivergent and SEN students). Working as part of a team and managing relationships in a high pressure environment such as on stage or in a recording session.

**Client management** - Managing 50+ stakeholders (parents, adult clients, music agencies, studios) requiring timely updates.

**Time management** - Managing 43+ lessons a week, lesson planning, prep work for gigs and studio sessions and business administration.
